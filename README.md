Implementing Tableau
This is project will be performed as one of the stakeholder like to see the Analysis of the bike sharing. For this analysis, we’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
 - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
 - Finally, we’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format 

### Convertion of the csv file into the data frame:

### Listing out the data types from the data frame objects:

## Exporting the dataframe without the index column

## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis :

### line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour :

###  line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, and the graph can be filtered by the hour and gender :

### heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week

### heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender:

### heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender
